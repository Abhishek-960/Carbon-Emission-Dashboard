# 🌍 CarbonScope: Global CO₂ Emissions Dashboard

An interactive and insightful Power BI report built to visualize and analyze global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across time, countries, and regions. This dashboard is designed to help users explore emission patterns, compare nations by total and per capita output, and gain valuable insights into climate-related data trends.


## 📝 Project Purpose

The **CarbonScope Dashboard** was developed to support researchers, policymakers, educators, and environmentally conscious users in understanding how CO₂ emissions are distributed globally. By visualizing emissions data in a dynamic and interactive format, this tool promotes informed decision-making and awareness around climate change.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was created using the following tools and technologies:

- **📊 Power BI Desktop** – For creating and designing the dashboard.
- **📂 Power Query** – For transforming and cleaning raw data tables.
- **🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for dynamic KPIs and custom logic.
- **🔗 Data Modeling** – Built relationships between tables to enable filtering and cross-report interaction.
- **📁 File Format** – `.pbix` for the working dashboard and `.png/.pdf` for visuals and documentation.


## 📚 Data Source

- **Primary Source**: [Our World in Data – CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)
- **Dataset Description**:
  - Country-level annual CO₂ emissions
  - Emissions per capita
  - Year-wise historical data
  - (Optional fields) GDP, population, and regional classification
- **Scope**:
  - 190+ countries
  - 1960 to recent year (based on latest dataset version)
  - Emissions measured in million metric tons (MtCO₂)


## 🔍 Business Problem

Climate change is a global challenge, but understanding how individual countries contribute to CO₂ emissions can be difficult when relying on raw spreadsheets. Governments, investors, NGOs, and educators often lack an intuitive visual tool to analyze and compare CO₂ trends over time and across continents.


## 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To build a clean, engaging, and interactive Power BI dashboard that:
- Tracks total and per capita CO₂ emissions globally
- Highlights top emitting countries
- Enables year-wise comparisons
- Supports decision-making around sustainability and policy efforts

## 💡 Business Impact & Insights

- **Policy Making**: Identify countries or regions needing stricter carbon regulation.
- **Education**: Help students visualize the environmental impact of economic growth.
- **ESG Investing**: Guide investors looking at sustainability-linked risk.
- **International Collaboration**: Facilitate regional comparisons and shared climate responsibility.


## 🧭 How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
2. Use the **Year** slicer to analyze different periods.
3. Select **Country/Continent** filters to explore regional trends.
4. Hover over maps and charts for tooltips.
5. Export visuals or PDFs for presentations or reports.


## 🧩 Future Enhancements (Planned)

- Add emissions by sector (transport, industry, etc.)
- Integrate GDP and energy consumption data
- Build mobile layout for phone access
- Include forecasts or machine learning trends
